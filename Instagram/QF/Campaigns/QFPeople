It absolutely breaks my heart to see the construction workers and security guards outside for hours, security can be done indoors under air conditioning and surveillance camers they don’t need to be outside!!! And the construction sites must have air conditioned trailers for the workers

advice from me that might be useful for the future of qatar to become an industrial country among arab countries. First, it would be better to prioritize education, especially following the example of East Asian countries which are famous for discipline and also qualified teachers, especially mathematics because it is the basis for higher sciences such as physics and chemistry, therefore it would be better to use teachers from abroad such as East Asia, Europe or the United States in order to have qualified graduate students. The second is investment cooperation, especially the automotive or electronics industry to build factories in Qatar by employing local residents or building their own state-owned factories with technological cooperation with large companies such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Panasonic and others for electronics and Honda, Ford, BMW and others for automotive.
