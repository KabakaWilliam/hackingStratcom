Dear friends! Look at the magic of colors ... Which he engraves like diamonds ... Glaze ... The works that he painted for 25 years ... Salvador Dali would have applauded him .. Exquisite painting for connoisseurs of beauty ... The genius of modern surrealism .. Alex Fadeev. We will hold an exhibition of the master's works in Qatar. @smart.painting

I write , I paint and try to live in peace . No actual words to describe what we as Palestinians face everyday , or what we had to deal with in childhood . All media can't cover 60% of what real life looks like , what everyday life feels like . To live with fears and hidden sorrow inside heart isn't something easy for all of us , cold memories and a lonely soul that can't find its own path still . As childhood is the most important stage in human's life , Palestinian people had a very tough one that formed the faces , personalities they have now . Maybe for some or many they still want to live their innocent dream childhood , even if 30 or 70 years passed from their journey , it will forever remain a right for them , for all the children around the world ; to have a jouful , energetic and...'peaceful' pages to remember . When seeing the differences their and outside , the heart feels even more sorry for the situation there . We have to believe more in Allah , everything will be okay , someday . @qatarfoundation .
