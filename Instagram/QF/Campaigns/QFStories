No doubt . Sidra has been taking care of me for the last 3 years after I was moved from HMC. Now they’re shifting me back to HMC cause I’m 19 and honestly nothing breaks my heart more then this . I’ll be leaving behind a family. I really hope sidra extends it’s care for everyone not just maternity unit . I have a family in sidra and I don’t wanna leave them back . Most of all *SIDRA IS THE GREATEST❤️*
