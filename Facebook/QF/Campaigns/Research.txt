I happened to be at Al Sidra Hospital along with my 11-year son this year. I found Al Sidra's Drs, Nurses and other staff highly professional, cooperative and energetic.

Sidra is the best.. we were having history of ectopic pregnancies, premature delivery and still birth.. but from Sidra, we got our baby girl in good health last month after completing full term. Thank to Dr. Varsha Mulik and the entire Sidra team.
