So the Sheik Harrah land was purchased ny Jews from the Ottoman so called owners. Jordan in 48 conqeured and annexed East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Jordan after ethnically cleansing every Jew from East Jerusalem gave land or homes to Palestinians. Jordan foolishly joined the war in 67 to destroy Israel by bombing and shelling West Jerusalem. So Jordan the occupier took land and gave it to many of the current residents. Rent is not paid so former owners go to court. I prefer compensation not eviction to all who lost property because there is not enough trust for any other solution .
