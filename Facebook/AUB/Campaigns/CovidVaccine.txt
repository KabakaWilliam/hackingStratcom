Hello, I am an alumni (class of 2002) so I can take the vaccine. But I also have my cousin (not aub, but will be 48 in a few months, and is the caretaker of his mother, is it possible that he can do it as well?) we are both registered on the moph covax platform. Thanks in advance.

This post means that students ,staffs or Alumni are not allowed to go inside Campus unless they are vaccinated ??Well freedom of decision is important i guess and especially in my second Home AUB.i believe precaution and mask are most important even if vaccinated.
I believe who takes care of others by abiding precaution rules not obliged to be vaccinated .
AUB should give the choice and freedom for those not willing to go for vaccination based on abiding by precaution rules.
With all respect freedom and decision related to vaccination still under researches need to be considered.

Rabih Kamel Hassan you have the choice to get vaccinated or not; if you are not vaccinated, you won't access campus - as simple as that. Soon you won't be able to visit spaces, such as gyms, restaurants, cinema, etc. This is something very common in many EU countries and in the US.

Rabih Kamel Hassan access for specific activities may still be possible (ie paper work) but limited to a permission given- like now, campus access is limited to essential activities. In the end, it’s going to be an admin decision-like in any other private establishment in Lebanon or abroad; without “green pass” you won’t be able to dine in, go to school, go to indoor pools, gyms, etc

Rabih Kamel Hassan - precautions should be taken regardless of vaccination status - especially if we have the virus roaming free in the community. Vaccines are one of the tools available to mitigate the risk of transmission. To the best of my knowledge, vaccines are not mandatory in most countries in the world. You are free to take it or not; if not, you can access campus virtually so that you don’t become a threat to yourself and others

Marco Bardus hello i respect your opinion but no access for a student for that reason is not fair at all.Welll i believe we are far from EU Countries and US ones and despite all you have the choice but access in any place is for resident people choice not for Govvernment choice .If you are not convinced still of researches done on vaccine its your life given by God and no one could oblige you especially if you take precautions to other.
